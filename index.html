        New New Suggestion: 
            Instead of adding a lot of buttons, just add one button that opens a dialogue for player info input and one for start/restart/newGame
            on right of header add theme toggle button
            Below the add button: 
                add Player Name: Symbol
        Add start button for those who want to enter names and choose their token, otherwise don't ask a thing and let players play immediately
        Add four buttons in order top to bottom: Player One, Player Two, (Single Player / Two Players), Start Game
        ADD a big O/X on dashboard during gameplay to represent who's turn it it
        On top below header add a text line saying it's playerName's turn (e.g. player one's turn)
        On winner screen:
            Header then player name then
            Add Green big X/O winner
            Change text to New Game and go to initial project state
    The dashboard is on the right screen side (if vw > vh) else on the bottom (if vh >= vw)
    The dashboard is on a card style with title on top (h1: Tic Tac Toe) the restart button, player names, player turn, display name, winner, theme switch button, choosing X or O, choosing two player or single player, start button (optional) and whatever else is required

To make it responsive on phone, the gameboard will be on top and the dashboard will be on bottom on a card
