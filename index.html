    No headers or footers will be in this game
    The entire tictactoe gameboard is on left full screen (a big squere)
    GameBoard:
        The gameboard is on the left side of screen or in the center middle
        The gameboard will resize equally entirely based on the screen size 
        Dark background with Neon Lightning Colored X and O will be used on the gameBoard as primary theme
        Use hover effect with a background white shadow wherever the mouse moves (simulate with onmousemove event) or by using hover
        Use SVG for X and O
        Secondary theme is whatever it is will work

        New Suggestion:
            New New Suggestion: 
                Instead of adding a lot of buttons, just add one button that opens a dialogue for player info input and one for start/restart/newGame
                on right of header add theme toggle button
                Below the add button: 
                    add Player Name: Symbol
            Add start button for those who want to enter names and choose their token, otherwise don't ask a thing and let players play immediately
            Add four buttons in order top to bottom: Player One, Player Two, (Single Player / Two Players), Start Game
            ADD a big O/X on dashboard during gameplay to represent who's turn it it
            On top below header add a text line saying it's playerName's turn (e.g. player one's turn)
            On winner screen:
                Header then player name then
                Add Green big X/O winner
                Change text to New Game and go to initial project state
        The dashboard is on the right screen side (if vw > vh) else on the bottom (if vh >= vw)
        The dashboard is on a card style with title on top (h1: Tic Tac Toe) the restart button, player names, player turn, display name, winner, theme switch button, choosing X or O, choosing two player or single player, start button (optional) and whatever else is required

    To make it responsive on phone, the gameboard will be on top and the dashboard will be on bottom on a card
